# Gotenberg Python Client

This is a Python client for interfacing with [Gotenberg](https://gotenberg.dev/), which in turn is a wrapper around
powerful tools for PDF generation and creation in various ways, using a stateless API. It's a very powerful tool
to generate and manipulate PDFs.

## Features

- HTTP/2 enabled by default
- Abstract away the handling of multi-part/form-data and deal with `Path`s instead
- Based on the modern [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx) library
- Full support for type hinting and concrete return types as much as possible
- Nearly full test coverage run against an actual Gotenberg server for multiple Python and PyPy versions

## Examples

Converting a single HTML file into a PDF:

```python
from gotenberg_client import GotenbergClient

with GotenbergClient("http://localhost:3000") as client:
    with client.chromium.html_to_pdf() as route:
      response = route.index("my-index.html").run()
      response.to_file(Path("my-index.pdf"))
```

Converting an HTML file with additional resources into a PDF:

```python
from gotenberg_client import GotenbergClient

with GotenbergClient("http://localhost:3000") as client:
    with client.chromium.html_to_pdf() as route:
      response = route.index("my-index.html").resource("image.png").resource("style.css").run()
      response.to_file(Path("my-index.pdf"))
```

Converting an HTML file with additional resources into a PDF/A1a format:

```python
from gotenberg_client import GotenbergClient
from gotenberg_client.options import PdfAFormat

with GotenbergClient("http://localhost:3000") as client:
    with client.chromium.html_to_pdf() as route:
      response = route.index("my-index.html").resources(["image.png", "style.css"]).pdf_format(PdfAFormat.A2b).run()
      response.to_file(Path("my-index.pdf"))
```

Converting a URL into PDF, in landscape format

```python
from gotenberg_client import GotenbergClient
from gotenberg_client.options import PageOrientation

with GotenbergClient("http://localhost:3000") as client:
    with client.chromium.html_to_pdf() as route:
      response = route.url("https://hello.world").orient(PageOrientation.Landscape).run()
      response.to_file(Path("my-world.pdf"))
```

To ensure the proper clean up of all used resources, both the client and the route(s) should be
used as context manager. If for some reason you cannot, you should `.close` the client and any
routes:

```python
from gotenberg_client import GotenbergClient

try:
  client = GotenbergClient("http://localhost:3000")
  try:
    route = client.merge(["myfile.pdf", "otherfile.pdf"]).run()
  finally:
    route.close()
finally:
  client.close()
```
