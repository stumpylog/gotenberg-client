## Questions and Support

## Feature Requests

We use the [Ideas category in Github Discussions](https://github.com/stumpylog/gotenberg-client/discussions/categories/ideas) for feature requests and project improvements. Please check existing discussions before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.

## Bug Reports

If you've identified a bug:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Create a new issue using the bug report template
3. Include:
   - Python version
   - gotenberg-client version
   - Gotenberg server version
   - Minimal code example demonstrating the bug
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Error messages/stack traces if applicable

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
1. Install [`uv`](https://astral.sh/uv/) for independent tool installations
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # Install uv
   ```
1. Install [`hatch`](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) and [`pre-commit`](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)
   ```bash
   uv tool install hatch pre-commit
   ```
1. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Code Style

We use [`hatch`](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) for project management, testing, and formatting:

- Run tests: `hatch test`
- Format & lint code: `hatch fmt`
- Check formatting: `hatch fmt --check`
- Check typing: `hatch run typing:run`
- Build documentation: `hatch run docs:build`

Please ensure all tests pass and code is properly formatted before submitting changes. The code must pass the CI to be merged.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes
3. Update tests and documentation
4. Run the test suite
5. Submit a PR against `develop`
6. Reference any related issues

PRs should:

- Focus on a single feature/fix
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow existing code style
