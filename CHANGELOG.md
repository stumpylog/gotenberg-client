- The `:edge` tag testing is now allowed to fail

- Updated test running image from 7.9.2 to 7.10.1
- For the moment, send both `pdfa` and `pdfFormat` for compatibility with 7.9 and 7.10
  - See [here](https://github.com/stumpylog/gotenberg-client/issues/5#issuecomment-1839081129) for some subtle differences in what these options mean

### Added

- Added new test job against Gotenberg's `:edge` tag

## [0.3.0] - 2023-10-17

### Added
